# Competitive Programminng
This is my collection of Python Programs that I have solved on various competitive programming websites.<br />

Each file contains a unique problem statement and its corresponding solution/solutions.

For beginners I would recommend:
* Start with SPOJ
* Then move on to HackerEarth
* Lastly solve CodeChef (_skip easy_)
